### FAQ Section

**Q: Which platform should I choose?**
A: Shopify is ideal for most fashion brands (faster setup, easier management). WooCommerce is best if you need a content-heavy site with blogging. We'll recommend the best fit during our discovery call.

**Q: Can I manage the site myself after launch?**
A: Absolutely! We provide comprehensive training and video tutorials. Both Shopify and WooCommerce have intuitive admin panels. We're always available for support.

**Q: Do you integrate with my existing product photography?**
A: Yes! We work with your existing product photos or can coordinate new photography through our photo services. We optimize all images for web performance.

**Q: What if I need to add more products later?**
A: You can easily add unlimited products yourself using the CMS. If you need design work for new collections or pages, we offer ongoing support packages starting at $2,000/month.

**Q: How long does it take to launch?**
A: Starter: 3-4 weeks, Professional: 5-6 weeks, Enterprise: 8-12 weeks. Rush options available for additional fee.

**Q: Do you handle domain and hosting?**
A: We help you set up your domain. Shopify includes hosting. WooCommerce requires separate hosting (we recommend WP Engine or Kinsta and can set it up for you).

**Q: Will my site be SEO optimized?**
A: Yes! All packages include SEO optimization: meta titles, descriptions, alt text, schema markup, XML sitemap, and page speed optimization.

**Q: Can you migrate my existing store?**
A: Yes! We offer migration services from any platform (Wix, Squarespace, BigCommerce, etc.) starting at $2,500 depending on complexity.
