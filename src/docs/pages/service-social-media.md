### FAQ Section

**Q: Do I need to provide content, or do you create everything?**
A: We create everything! From photoshoots to captions to hashtags. You just approve the content calendar and we handle the rest. If you have existing content or want to be involved in photoshoots, we can work with that too.

**Q: How fast will I gain followers?**
A: Organic growth varies, but our clients average 1,000-5,000 new followers/month depending on package and niche. Growth is fastest with our Growth & Premium packages due to more content + influencer partnerships.

**Q: Do I get to approve posts before they go live?**
A: Yes! We send you a content calendar for approval at the start of each month. You can request changes to any post. For time-sensitive content (Stories, trending Reels), we may post in real-time per your approval preferences.

**Q: What if I want to post something myself?**
A: Totally fine! We'll work around your personal posts. Just let us know in advance so we can adjust the calendar. Many clients do a mix (we handle 90%, they do spontaneous Stories 10%).

**Q: How do you measure success?**
A: We track follower growth, engagement rate, reach, profile visits, website clicks, and (most importantly) revenue from Instagram Shopping. Monthly reports show all metrics + insights.

**Q: Can you guarantee follower growth?**
A: We can't guarantee specific numbers (Instagram algorithm changes), but 95% of our clients see 200%+ follower growth in the first 6 months. If you're not seeing growth, we adjust strategy at no extra cost.

**Q: Do you use bots or fake followers?**
A: Never. All our growth is 100% organic or from vetted influencer partnerships. We build real, engaged communities that actually buy your products.

**Q: What platforms do you recommend?**
A: Instagram is essential for fashion (that's where your customers are). TikTok is great for viral growth if you're targeting Gen Z. Pinterest is excellent for driving long-term traffic. We'll recommend based on your audience.
