### 🏆 Feature Ranking & Analysis

| Rank | Feature | What It Does | Real-World Example | AI Agent / Automation | Score /100 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Critical Path Auto-Detection** | Finds the one task blocking everything. | Model fittings aren’t approved → runway order, lighting rehearsal, and call sheet are all blocked. | **Critical Path Scanner** (Graph Analysis) | **99** |
| **2** | **Dependency Cascade Simulator** | Shows what breaks if a task slips. | Venue access delayed 2h → soundcheck shifts → doors open late → sponsor exposure drops. | **Butterfly Effect Simulator** (Predictive Modeling) | **98** |
| **3** | **AI Task Orchestration** | Converts a brief into structured tasks. | "NYFW runway show" → AI generates 120 tasks across casting, venue, backstage, press. | **Orchestrator Agent** (Generative Workflow) | **97** |
| **4** | **Risk-Based Task Prioritization** | Ranks tasks by failure impact. | "Power load confirmation" ranks higher than "Seating chart polish" because failure kills the show. | **Risk Guardian** (Impact Analysis) | **96** |
| **5** | **Live Task State Sync** | One task updates multiple systems. | "Looks Approved" → wardrobe timeline, backstage checklist, and media shot list update instantly. | **State Sync Engine** (Real-time Event Bus) | **95** |
| **6** | **Context-Aware Task AI** | AI reasons only inside one task. | Inside "Confirm Model Lineup," AI suggests replacements based on body measurements + availability. | **Task Copilot** (Contextual Reasoning) | **94** |
| **7** | **Task-Driven Budget Updates** | Tasks update cost forecasts. | "Add extra lighting rig" → budget jumps +12% → sponsor gap flagged immediately. | **Budget Watchdog** (Dynamic Costing) | **94** |
| **8** | **AI Blocker Explanation** | Explains *why* a task is blocked. | "Venue contract pending because insurance certificate missing from supplier." | **Blocker Analyst** (Causal Chain) | **93** |
| **9** | **Subtask Intelligence** | Detects missing subtasks. | "Model Casting" → AI adds visas, fittings, call-time confirmations automatically. | **Detail Architect** (Completeness Check) | **92** |
| **10** | **Task-to-Asset Linking** | Tasks connect to real objects. | "Approve Look #14" linked directly to garment photos + model fitting images. | **Visual Asset Mapper** (Multimodal Linking) | **91** |
| **11** | **Automated Task Verification** | Confirms tasks are actually done. | AI checks uploaded permits instead of trusting "Approved" checkbox. | **Compliance Auditor** (Document Vision) | **90** |
| **12** | **Phase-Aware Task Visibility** | Hides tasks that don't matter yet. | Post-event PR recap tasks hidden during pre-production to reduce noise. | **Focus Manager** (UI State) | **89** |
| **13** | **Deadline Drift Detection** | Detects silent slippage. | Tasks marked "on track" but approvals taking longer than historical average. | **Velocity Tracker** (Trend Analysis) | **88** |
| **14** | **AI Task Health Signals** | Simple health states vs. %. | "Runway Lighting" shows **At Risk** instead of "63% complete." | **Health Monitor** (Semantic Status) | **88** |
| **15** | **Task-Triggered Alerts (Selective)** | Alerts only when needed. | Producer alerted only when delay threatens show start—not every comment. | **Noise Filter** (Relevance Scoring) | **87** |
| **16** | **Scenario-Aware Task Replanning** | Adjusts tasks for scenarios. | Rain forecast → outdoor rehearsal moved indoors → crew schedule recalculated. | **Contingency Planner** (Scenario Logic) | **86** |
| **17** | **AI Task Impact Scoring** | Scores damage if task fails. | Missing "Garment steaming" = minor; missing "Fire marshal approval" = catastrophic. | **Impact Assessor** (Severity Weighting) | **85** |
| **18** | **Role-Filtered Task Views** | Everyone sees only what they need. | Photographer sees shot timing only; producer sees budget + risk tasks. | **Role Scope Lens** (Permission Filtering) | **84** |
| **19** | **Natural Language Task Updates** | Plain language updates tasks. | "Lighting is done" → correct task closed, dependencies unlocked. | **NLP Command Processor** (Intent Recognition) | **83** |
| **20** | **Post-Task Outcome Analysis** | Learns from past failures. | AI learns late fittings cause most delays → flags them earlier next event. | **Retrospective Learner** (Pattern Recognition) | **82** |

### 🧩 Core AI Agents & Workflows

To support these features, the following AI Agents are architected into the system:

1.  **The Orchestrator:** Decomposes briefs into executable work breakdown structures (WBS).
2.  **The Risk Guardian:** Continuously scans the task graph for critical path violations and budget leakage.
3.  **The Visual Asset Mapper:** Ensures every task is grounded in the physical reality of the show (Looks, Venue, Talent).
4.  **The State Sync Engine:** Maintains truth across the disparate "Work Drawers" (Runway, Press, Logistics).

### 🚀 Implementation Priority

*   **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Critical Path Detection, Task Orchestration, Risk Prioritization.
*   **Phase 2 (Intelligence):** Context-Aware AI, Budget Updates, Blocker Explanation.
*   **Phase 3 (Automation):** Task Verification, Asset Linking, Scenario Replanning.
