Subtitle: Generated by Gemini 3 Pro

## PRIMARY GOAL
Answer: “Given this brand, what content should we produce to drive sales — across all channels?”

## CHANNELS REQUIRED

## GLOBAL UI RULES
- Calm luxury, editorial typography, soft shadows, rounded cards, generous spacing.

## HEADER

## SECTION 1 — STRATEGY HERO CARD
- Campaign name + AI badge
- Primary goal: Conversion / Brand lift
- Tone keywords
- Channel coverage pills (each pill shows planned outputs count)

## SECTION 2 — CHANNEL OUTPUT PACKS (NEW)
Create a horizontal swipe row of premium cards, one per channel:
Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, Shopify, Amazon, Website

Each channel card must display:
- Formats included (ratio + duration where relevant)
- Planned outputs count
- Usage tags: Organic / Ads / PDP

## MENTAL MODEL NOTES

### The new mental model: “AI Cards = mini creative briefs”
Each card is one decision the AI made. Each card answers 4 things:
1. **What** (deliverable)
2. **Where** (channel)
3. **Spec** (size/ratio/duration)
4. **Purpose** (PDP conversion, ads, discovery)

The user can adjust the card only if they turn on **Adjust Mode**.

### What “Editable AI Cards” means in practice
**Default view: AI Recommended (clean + locked)**
- Cards show AI outputs
- No edit controls
- Fast to review
- One big CTA: Approve & Generate Proposal

**Adjust Mode (power-user editing without chaos)**
- When toggled ON:
- Every card reveals chips + +/- controls
- You can change quantity, channel, format, with/without model
- No deep forms, no extra steps
- This prevents “death by micro-edits” while still letting pros fine-tune.

### What changes on the Summary Screen (clearest breakdown)

**A) You add “Channel Output Packs” (this is the big upgrade)**
Right now you have a shot list. But brands don’t buy “packshots”… they buy Instagram deliverables + PDP images + Amazon listing sets + ads.
So we add a row of cards:
- **Instagram Pack:** Feed, Carousel, Reels, Stories. Output: “12 deliverables”
- **Amazon Pack:** Hero white background, Lifestyle, Infographic, Video loop. Output: “9 assets”
- **TikTok Pack:** 9:16 UGC style, Spark-ready. Output: “6 videos”

These packs make the plan feel like a distribution system, not a shoot checklist.

**B) Your shot list becomes “Asset Recipes” (better than generic shots)**
Instead of “Packshots” or “Lifestyle reels”, show cards like:
- **PDP Conversion Set:** Shopify (8 images) + Amazon (7 images + infographic). Rationale: “Improves product understanding.”
- **Lifestyle Sets:** Instagram (Carousel) + Reel covers.

**C) Ads become first-class outputs (not optional)**
Add an “Ads Creative” section with AI cards like:
- Instagram Reels Ad (Hook A/B)
- TikTok Spark-ready Cut
- Facebook Carousel Ad
- Pinterest Ad Pin Set

**Mobile-only card behavior**
- Cards collapsed by default
- Tap expands (“details + specs + reasoning”)
- Horizontal swipe row for Channel Packs
- Sticky bottom CTA always visible
- **Adjust Mode:** quick chips + +/- (no typing)
- **Gestures:** Long-press to pin, Swipe left to generate variants.
